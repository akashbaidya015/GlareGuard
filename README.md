# GlareGuard

This project, Adaptive Headlights, is based on a simple yet common problem many drivers face. Have you ever experienced that moment of discomfort while driving at night when an oncoming vehicle has its headlights on full beam, shining directly into your eyes? It becomes extremely difficult to see the road or other vehicles, and the worst part is—you have no way to tell the other driver to dim their headlights. You're both in your own cars, and there's no easy way to communicate that discomfort.

And here’s where the twist comes in.

In our solution, every vehicle is equipped with a sensor in its headlights. These sensors are designed to detect when another vehicle's headlights are shining too brightly in their direction. Based on the intensity of that incoming light, the system automatically lowers the brightness or angle of its own headlights to reduce glare for the oncoming driver.

The headlights will still serve their main purpose—illuminating the road a few meters ahead—but as soon as they detect another vehicle approaching, the beam is temporarily redirected slightly downward to prevent it from hitting the other driver's eyes directly. Once the vehicle passes, the lights return to their original position.

What makes Adaptive Headlights powerful is that it enables communication without words. You want to ask the other driver to dim their lights, but you can’t. So your car does it for them—and theirs does it for you. It’s automatic, respectful, and makes night driving safer and more comfortable for everyone on the road.
